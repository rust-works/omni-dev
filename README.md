A powerful Git commit message analysis and amendment toolkit written in Rust.

## Features

- üîç **Commit Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of git commits with YAML output
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Smart Amendment**: Amend single or multiple commit messages safely
- üéØ **Conventional Commits**: Automatic detection and suggestions for conventional commit format
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safety First**: Working directory validation and error recovery
- üìä **Rich Information**: File changes, diff summaries, and remote branch tracking
- ‚ö° **Fast & Reliable**: Built with Rust for memory safety and performance

## Installation

### From crates.io

```bash
cargo install omni-dev
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rust-works/omni-dev.git
cd omni-dev
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# View and analyze commits
omni-dev git commit message view HEAD~3..HEAD

# Amend commit messages from a YAML file
omni-dev git commit message amend amendments.yaml

# Get help
omni-dev --help
```

### Viewing Commits

Analyze commits in a range and get comprehensive information:

```bash
# Analyze recent commits
omni-dev git commit message view HEAD~5..HEAD

# Analyze commits since main branch
omni-dev git commit message view origin/main..HEAD
```

This outputs detailed YAML with:
- Commit metadata (hash, author, date)
- File changes and diff statistics
- Conventional commit type detection
- Proposed commit message improvements
- Remote branch tracking information

### Amending Commits

Create a YAML file with your desired commit message changes:

```yaml
amendments:
  - commit: "abc123def456..."
    message: |
      feat: add user authentication system
      
      Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication with JWT tokens:
      - Add login and logout endpoints  
      - Implement token validation middleware
      - Add user session management
```

Then apply the amendments:

```bash
omni-dev git commit message amend amendments.yaml
```

The tool safely handles:
- Single HEAD commit amendments
- Multi-commit amendments via interactive rebase
- Working directory safety checks
- Automatic error recovery
