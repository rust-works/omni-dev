An intelligent Git commit message toolkit with AI-powered contextual
intelligence. Transform messy commit histories into professional,
conventional commit formats with project-aware suggestions.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Intelligence**: Claude AI analyzes your code changes to
  suggest meaningful commit messages and PR descriptions
- üß† **Contextual Awareness**: Understands your project structure,
  conventions, and work patterns
- üîç **Comprehensive Analysis**: Deep analysis of commits, branches, and
  file changes
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Smart Amendments**: Safely improve single or multiple commit messages
- üöÄ **PR Creation**: Generate professional pull requests with AI-powered
  descriptions
- üì¶ **Automatic Batching**: Handles large commit ranges intelligently
- üéØ **Conventional Commits**: Automatic detection and formatting
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safety First**: Working directory validation and error recovery
- ‚ö° **Fast & Reliable**: Built with Rust for memory safety and performance

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from crates.io
cargo install omni-dev

# Install with Nix
nix profile install github:rust-works/omni-dev

# Install with Nix flakes (development)
nix run github:rust-works/omni-dev

# Enable binary cache for faster builds (optional)
cachix use omni-dev

# Set up Claude API key (required for AI features)
export CLAUDE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

#### Nix Binary Cache (Optional)

For faster Nix builds, you can use the binary cache:

```bash
# Install cachix if you don't have it
nix profile install nixpkgs#cachix

# Enable the omni-dev binary cache
cachix use omni-dev

# Now Nix installations will use pre-built binaries instead of compiling from source
nix profile install github:rust-works/omni-dev
```

*Watch omni-dev transform messy commits into professional ones with AI-powered analysis*

### 30-Second Demo

Transform your commit messages and create professional PRs with AI intelligence:

```bash
# Analyze and improve commit messages in your current branch
omni-dev git commit message twiddle 'origin/main..HEAD' --use-context

# Before: "fix stuff", "wip", "update files"
# After:  "feat(auth): implement OAuth2 authentication system"
#         "docs(api): add comprehensive endpoint documentation"
#         "fix(ui): resolve mobile responsive layout issues"

# Create a professional PR with AI-generated description
omni-dev git branch create pr
# üéâ Generates comprehensive PR with detailed description, testing info, and more
```

## üìã Core Commands

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Commit Improvement (`twiddle`)

The star feature - intelligently improve your commit messages with real-time model information display:

```bash
# Improve commits with contextual intelligence
omni-dev git commit message twiddle 'origin/main..HEAD' --use-context

# Process large commit ranges with automatic batching
omni-dev git commit message twiddle 'HEAD~20..HEAD' --batch-size 5

# Save suggestions to file for review
omni-dev git commit message twiddle 'HEAD~5..HEAD' \
  --save-only suggestions.yaml

# Auto-apply improvements without confirmation
omni-dev git commit message twiddle 'HEAD~3..HEAD' --auto-apply
```

### üîç Analysis Commands

```bash
# Analyze commits in detail (YAML output)
omni-dev git commit message view 'HEAD~3..HEAD'

# Analyze current branch vs main
omni-dev git branch info main

# Get comprehensive help
omni-dev help-all
```

### üöÄ AI-Powered PR Creation

Create professional pull requests with AI-generated descriptions:

```bash
# Generate and create PR with AI-powered description
omni-dev git branch create pr

# Create PR with specific base branch
omni-dev git branch create pr main

# Save PR details to file without creating
omni-dev git branch create pr --save-only pr-description.yaml

# Auto-create without confirmation
omni-dev git branch create pr --auto-apply
```

### ‚úèÔ∏è Manual Amendment

```bash
# Apply specific amendments from YAML file
omni-dev git commit message amend amendments.yaml
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Commands

```bash
# Show supported AI models and their specifications
omni-dev config models show

# View model information with token limits and capabilities
omni-dev config models show | grep -A5 "claude-sonnet-4"
```

## üß† Contextual Intelligence

omni-dev understands your project context to provide better suggestions:

### Project Configuration

Create `.omni-dev/` directory in your repo root:

```bash
mkdir .omni-dev
```

#### Scope Definitions (`.omni-dev/scopes.yaml`)

```yaml
scopes:
  - name: "auth"
    description: "Authentication and authorization systems"
    examples: ["auth: add OAuth2 support", "auth: fix token validation"]
    file_patterns: ["src/auth/**", "auth.rs"]
  
  - name: "api"
    description: "REST API endpoints and handlers"  
    examples: ["api: add user endpoints", "api: improve error responses"]
    file_patterns: ["src/api/**", "handlers/**"]
```

#### Commit Guidelines (`.omni-dev/commit-guidelines.md`)

```markdown
# Project Commit Guidelines

## Format
- Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
- Keep subject line under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"

## Our Scopes
- `auth` - Authentication systems
- `api` - REST API changes
- `ui` - Frontend/UI components
```

## üéØ Advanced Features

### Intelligent Context Detection

omni-dev automatically detects:

- **Project Conventions**: From `.omni-dev/`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **Work Patterns**: Feature development, bug fixes, documentation,
  refactoring
- **Branch Context**: Extracts work type from branch names
  (`feature/auth-system`)
- **File Architecture**: Understands UI, API, core logic, configuration
  changes
- **Change Significance**: Adjusts detail level based on impact

### Automatic Batching

Large commit ranges are automatically split into manageable batches:

```bash
# Processes 50 commits in batches of 4 (default)
omni-dev git commit message twiddle 'HEAD~50..HEAD' --use-context

# Custom batch size for very large ranges
omni-dev git commit message twiddle 'main..HEAD' --batch-size 2
```

### Command Options

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--use-context` | Enable contextual intelligence | `--use-context` |
| `--batch-size N` | Set batch size for large ranges | `--batch-size 3` |
| `--context-dir PATH` | Custom context directory | `--context-dir ./config` |
| `--auto-apply` | Apply without confirmation | `--auto-apply` |
| `--save-only FILE` | Save to file without applying | `--save-only fixes.yaml` |
| `--edit` | Edit amendments in external editor | `--edit` |

## üìñ Real-World Examples

### Before & After

**Before**: Messy commit history

```text
