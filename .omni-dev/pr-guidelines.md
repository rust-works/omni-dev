## Overview

A well-written pull request serves multiple purposes:

- **Documentation**: Explains what changed and why
- **Review Aid**: Helps reviewers understand context and focus areas
- **Project History**: Creates searchable record for future reference
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures all necessary steps are completed

### Key Principles

1. **Clarity**: Write for reviewers who may not have context
2. **Completeness**: Include all necessary information for review
3. **Conciseness**: Be thorough but avoid unnecessary verbosity
4. **Actionability**: Provide clear testing and validation steps

## PR Title Guidelines

### Format
Use conventional commit format for consistency:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

### Types
- `feat`: New features or enhancements
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without functional changes
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: CI/CD pipeline changes

### Scope Examples
- `auth`: Authentication systems
- `api`: REST API changes
- `ui`: User interface components
- `cli`: Command-line interface
- `core`: Core application logic
- `docs`: Documentation system

### Title Best Practices

✅ **Good Examples:**
- `feat(auth): implement OAuth2 Google integration`
- `fix(api): resolve rate limiting edge case in user endpoints`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions for macOS`
- `refactor(core): extract common validation logic`

❌ **Avoid:**
- `Update stuff` (too vague)
- `Fix bug` (no context)
- `Add new feature for users` (too verbose)
- `WIP: working on auth` (should not be merged)

## Description Best Practices

### Structure
1. **What**: Clear summary of changes
2. **Why**: Motivation and context
3. **How**: Implementation approach (if complex)
4. **Impact**: User-facing or architectural implications

### Writing Style
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Be specific about changes made
- Explain non-obvious decisions
- Link to relevant issues or discussions

### Technical Details
- Include architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Mention performance implications
- Note any breaking changes prominently
- Reference related documentation

## Template Section Guidelines

### Description Section
**Purpose**: Provide clear, comprehensive overview of changes

**Best Practices:**
- Start with one-sentence summary
- Explain the problem being solved
- Describe the solution approach
- Mention user-facing impact

**Example:**
```markdown
## Description

This PR implements OAuth2 authentication for Google and GitHub providers, enabling users to sign in without creating separate accounts. The implementation follows OAuth2 best practices and includes comprehensive error handling for edge cases like expired tokens and network failures.

The changes include a new authentication service, middleware for token validation, and updated UI components for the login flow.
```

### Type of Change Section
**Purpose**: Categorize the PR for reviewers and release notes

**Guidelines:**

```

### Checklist Section
**Purpose**: Ensure code quality and completeness

**Guidelines:**
- Only check items that are actually complete
- Add project-specific items as needed
- Use as final quality gate before review
- Don't skip items that don't apply - explain why

### Breaking Changes Section
**Purpose**: Highlight backward compatibility issues

**Guidelines:**
- Only use for actual breaking changes
- Provide clear migration instructions
- Include version information if applicable
- Link to migration guides

**Example:**
```markdown
## Breaking Changes

**API Changes:**
- The `/auth` endpoint now requires `provider` parameter
- Legacy password authentication deprecated (will be removed in v2.0)

**Migration Required:**
1. Update API calls to include `provider: "local"` for existing users
