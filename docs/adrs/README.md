# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the omni-dev project.

An ADR is a short document that captures a single significant architectural or design decision
along with its context and consequences. ADRs give current and future contributors a way to
understand *why* the system is shaped the way it is, not just *how* it works.

For more background on the practice, see
